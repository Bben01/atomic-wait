Cross platform atomic wait and wake (aka futex) functionality.

This crate only supports functionality that's available on all of
Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and macOS. That is:

- Only `AtomicU32` is supported.
  (Linux currently only supports 32-bit futexes.)
- Only the "wait", "wake one", and "wake all" operations are supported.
  (Linux supports more operations, but Windows and macOS don't.)
- No timeouts.
  (macOS doesn't have a stable/public API for timeouts.)
- The wake operations don't return the number of threads woken up.
  (Only Linux supports this.)

Supported platforms:
   Linux 2.6.22+,
   FreeBSD 11+,
   Windows 8+, Windows Server 2012+,
   macOS 11+, iOS 14+, watchOS 7+.

## Usage

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32;
use atomic_wait::{wait, wake_one, wake_all};

let a = AtomicU32::new(0);

wait(&a, 1); // If the value is 1, wait.

wake_one(&a); // Wake one waiting thread.

wake_all(&a); // Wake all waiting threads.
```

## Implementation

On Linux, this uses the `SYS_futex` syscall.

On FreeBSD, this uses the `_umtx_op` syscall.

On Windows, this uses the `WaitOnAddress` and `WakeByAddress` APIs.

On macOS (and iOS and watchOS), this uses `libc++`, making use of the same
(ABI-stable) functions behind C++20's `atomic_wait` and `atomic_notify` functions.
